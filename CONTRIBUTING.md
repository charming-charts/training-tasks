# How to contribute to Charming Charts

The workshops are based on several topics and principles. Topics are linked to
individual seminars and principles span across all seminars. Each topic could
represent a type of data to visualize, a story to be told or a hint on
visualizations. The workshops are not that focused on syntax as it could be done
in any visualization tool (e.g. ggplot2, d3s, altair, matplotlib, ...). We're
using plotly as a main tool but students should be able to follow tasks even if
they pick any other tool (given they are familiar with the tool enough).

Each topic is spread out across several situations / formats. First, we need to
make sure all students are familiar with the syntax for the functions we're
going to use and the datasets we're going to use.

- Introduction of the home assignments. We show the main functions used in the
  assignments, especially arguments necessary for the tasks.
- Home assignments. Simple tasks written in imperative way (e.g. create a
  scatter plot, change color to blue, etc.). The tasks go with "almost ready"
  code or core where one or more arguments are blanked.
- Presentation of the topic. We present the topic in form of interactively
  solving a task assigned in declarative way (e.g. use data tu support idea...,
  describe how two groups differ, etc.).

## Topics

Following list is not in any particular order. This should be revisited to make
sure it starts from tasks that need the simplest syntax.

- Time Series
- Comparing Numerical Variables
- Slice and Dice: Ditching Pie Charts for Better Data Viz
- The Great Divide: Visualizing Group Differences
- Remove Legend to Become a Legend (maybe not entire topic, just a principle)
- Beyond Mean and Variance: Visualizing Distributions

## Principles

Each principle should have its own slide (or two) in presentation. But the point
is that every chart we show should follow the principle. It would be good if the
principle was presented before any use. So this could also affect order of
topics so that we don't present too many principles at a time.

- Zero based axes
- No legends
- Keep color palette consistent
- Simplicity ?
- Add commentary (incl clever captions)

There are also some meta-principles worth mentioning. Everything else should
follow from these principles. These should be presented at the very beginning,
and we should loop around them throughout all workshops.

- Think about the message
- Think about the audience
- Think about the medium
